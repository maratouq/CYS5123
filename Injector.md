> #### What are injections?
Taking it from software perspective, injection is a type of cyber attacks that refer to broad class of attack vectors, that allows an attacker to inject malicious input into the system, network or application, which get processed by an interpreter as part of a command or a query.
Injections are among the oldest and most dangerous attacks aimed at web applications. The main reasons for that consideration is that:
- The attack surface is enormous
- Injection attacks are very well understood vulnerability class and free automatic tools that run such attacks made it possible for even unexperienced attackers to abuse those vulnerabilities.

The primary reason that allows for injection attacks is insufficient user input validation, and that input can make its way to calls to external resources through the system or program, such as system, exec, fork, Runtime.exec, SQL queries, or whatever the syntax is for making requests to interpreters in the environment
