Backdoors can be installed on different parts of the system, the hardware or the software, and can either be installed by hardware manufacturers and software designers as a deliberant means to ease future access to the system for troubleshooting and resolving issues, or by cybercriminals for criminal intentions.

To be able to successfully install a backdoor, the system first should be compromised and access to device should be gained either by:
- Gaining pyhisical access
- A malware attack
- Exploiting system vulnerability  
<br></br>

As mentioned eariler, backdoors can be installed with the criminal intention away from mind by manufacturers and designers to gain future access to the system, considering the other side, backdoors ease the path for cyber criminal activities even if they don't constitute sobtage directly. They play cruical roles in targetted attacks, as they allow to take control of affected systems.

Cybercriminals can use backdoors to install all means of malware and apply several techniques such as: 
- Port binding
- Port listening
- Port re-use
- Connection availability abuse
- Connect-Back Technique
- Legitimate platform abuse
- Common service protocol abuse
- Custom DNS Lookup Use
- DDOS attacks
- Cryptojacking
